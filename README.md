# AIDS Infection Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that builds and evaluates a machine learning model to predict the risk of AIDS infection. The model leverages various data points and features related to health and demographic information to provide insights into potential infection risks.

## Project Overview

This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the risk of AIDS infection using relevant health and demographic data.

The notebook demonstrates the following key steps:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset, handling missing values and preparing the data for modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze the data to understand trends, relationships, and distribution of variables.
- Model Building: Train a machine learning model to predict AIDS infection based on the input data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Conclusions and Insights: Interpret the results and discuss the significance of the model.
  
## To use the notebook: 
- Open the AIDS_infection_prediction.ipynb notebook in Google Colab by following the link or uploading it directly.
- Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to load the dataset and train the model.
- Explore the data analysis and model results.

## Content:
### Dataset
The dataset used for this prediction is referenced within the notebook. The dataset used contains various features such as:

- Demographic Information: Age, gender, etc.
- Health-related data: Medical history, immune system health, and other indicators.
- Other Factors: Lifestyle or risk behaviors that may influence infection rates.
  
### Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the following steps were taken to preprocess the data:

- Handling of missing values.
- Feature encoding.
- Data normalization/scaling.
- Train-test split to evaluate model performance.
  
### Model
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation have been employed to optimize the model's performance.
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
